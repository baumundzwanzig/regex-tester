# regex-tester

This is my first extension i have ever made and published. I was tired switching from Regex101 to VSCode all the time. So I made this extension to display groups and matches directlly in VSCode. Actually this is extension was vibe coded with Github Copilot.

## Features

+ Highlighting of matches and groups
+ Outputs the strings of all detected matches and groups
+ When clicking anywhere in the editor, the highlighting disapears.
+ Accessible thruogh a button in the header of the open tab.

## Known Issues

+ Highlighting sometimes make text hard to read on specific themes.
+ You can always run one RegEx at a time and u have to reopen the extension
+ Theres only a text "Find RegEx" in the header of the tab. In the future i want to change that to an icon.

## Release Notes

### 0.3.0

+ Added icon instead of text for toggeling the command
+ added Keybinding (CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+R)

### 0.1.5

I added RegEx flags, which can be specified after you typed in the RegEx itself.

### 0.1.0 

Initial release.
