# regex-tester

This is my first extension i have ever made and published. I was tired switching from Regex101 to VSCode all the time. So I made this extension to display groups and matches directlly in VSCode. Actually this is extension was vibe coded with Github Copilot.

## Features

+ Highlighting of matches and groups
+ Outputs the strings of all detected matches and groups
+ When clicking anywhere in the editor, the highlighting disapears.
+ Accessible thruogh a button in the header of the open tab and Keybinding (CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+R)
+ You can select a text in the editor an rightclick. Then you will be able to click on "Find RegEx from selection" and you can look for the marked RegEx instantly.

## Known Issues

+ Highlighting sometimes make text hard to read on specific themes.
+ You can always run one RegEx at a time and u have to reopen the extension
